 # 🐾 Animal Image Classification using CNN
</div>
# 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an Animal Image Classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow / Keras.
The model is trained to classify animal images based on visual features such as shape, texture, and color.

The entire implementation is provided in the Jupyter Notebook:

# 📓 animals.ipynb

# 🚀 Features

Image preprocessing and reshaping

CNN model built from scratch

Uses Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers

Training and evaluation on image dataset

Visualization of sample images

Deep learning–based classification

# 🧠 Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Matplotlib

TensorFlow / Keras

Jupyter Notebook



# 🖼️ Dataset Description

Images are resized to 100 × 100 × 3

RGB images are used

Dataset is split into:

Training set

Testing set

Labels are reshaped for binary / multi-class classification

🏗️ Model Architecture

The CNN model includes:

Convolutional layers (Conv2D)

Pooling layers (MaxPooling2D)

Dropout for regularization

Fully connected (Dense) layers

ReLU activation functions

Output layer for classification

# 🧪 Sample Visualization

The notebook randomly selects and displays training images to verify:

Correct image loading
